<p>The arm only bends from straight out to up against the shoulder in a curl manner. The same thing I faced while I was very new to gym and I did the back exercise where I did seated wide-grip low rowLF cable. My arm were also became very stiff just like they were not bending. If you have been doing curls that were painful that lock is typical. If your arms are still complete jelly after stretching and rest days do a toned down version of your normal workout and stop when you need to.
