<p>Come here to discuss the workouts the results and get help from your fellow OTFers. We are operated and moderated by community members and we are not affiliated with the Orangetheory. Collection of Floor Exercises. The unofficial community for anyone interested in Orangetheory Fitness. Your coaches would should rather see 6 or 7 PERFECT reps rather than 5 mediocre reps and 5 sloppy reps because you wore yourself out just trying to get to 10. I want to create a sheet of all the things we do on the floor and a quick explanation so I can pick a body part and do those sets of exercises.
