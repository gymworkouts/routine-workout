<p>Swimmers should get plenty of rest on the sprints and work. Swimmers may swim whatever speed they wish. Be sure to turn off your pace clock or have the swimmers. Once a swimmer achieves his three points he warms down and is done with practice. Tapering means a lot more than resting and is a long process to prepare the athlete for a series of championship meets or The Big.</p>
